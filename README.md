# vive-nvw

I am trying to get a vive-tracker used to move through a navisworks model.

Later:
Move the tracker along a printed plan and place the viewpoint on the same position and viewdirection.

I used openvr (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) and ViveTrack-Dynamo (https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/ViveTrack-Dynamo) as a basis.
